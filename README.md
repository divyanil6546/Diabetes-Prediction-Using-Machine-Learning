presenting my final year project in
Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
description-
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, ensuring a robust and comprehensive collection of relevant medical and demographic data. The project begins with data collection and preprocessing, where the dataset is cleaned to handle any missing values and normalized to ensure consistency in the features. Following this, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution of the data and to visualize key features that correlate with diabetes.

In the feature selection phase, statistical methods and machine learning techniques are employed to identify the most relevant features that contribute to the prediction of diabetes. The KNN model is then developed and trained using these selected features. Hyperparameter optimization is performed to enhance the model’s performance, ensuring that the predictions are as accurate as possible.

Model evaluation is a critical component of this project. The KNN model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, to ensure a comprehensive assessment of its performance. These metrics provide insights into the model’s ability to correctly predict diabetes and to balance the trade-offs between different types of errors.

The tools and technologies used in this project include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook. These tools facilitate efficient data manipulation, model development, and visualization. The project repository includes detailed instructions on how to use the project: clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the provided Jupyter notebooks to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

Contributions to the project are encouraged. Interested contributors can fork the repository and submit pull requests with improvements or new features. This collaborative approach aims to refine the model and expand its capabilities, ultimately enhancing its utility in predicting diabetes and aiding in early diagnosis and prevention strategies.
